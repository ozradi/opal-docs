In this article we will look deeper on OPAL architecture and discuss each part separately.

- Components numbered in the diagram
### 1 - The OPAL Server
The Server managing data and policy; exposing REST routes for clients to retrieve configurations and Pub/Sub channel for clients to subscribe to updates.

### 2 - The OPAL Client
The client, running at edge, adjacent to a policy-agent. 
The client subscribes to data and policy updates & act's on data-updates to approach data sources and aggregate data from them.
Clients open an outgoing websocket connection to servers, thus overcoming most firewall / networking challenges, creating a bi-directional Pub/Sub channel.

### 3 - Open-Policy-Agent (OPA)
The policy engine OPAL augments - by default this is OPA. OPAL can be extended to support other policy agents.

### 4 - Application services
The application OPAL powers the authorization layer for.

### 5 - Data service
Services that connect to the OPAL-server to notify of changes to authorization data. The updates guide OPAL to aggregate data from the relevant data-sources.

### 6 - GIT repository
A versioned store for the authorization policy. OPAL can be extended to support any version control repository.
Triggers a webhook to the OPAL server to notify of policy changes.

### 7 - Data sources
Various services that hold and serve data that needs to be used for authorization decisions (by the policy agents)
Examples:
- App REST API service for user list
- SQL DB storing user roles
- Billing SaaS service (e.g. Stripe)
OPAL-Clients can be extended to allow extraction of data from any sources.

### 8 - OPAL admins
The admins of OPAL are the developers that maintain the application.
The admins can:
- Drive new policies in real-time by simply pushing to their version control (Can simply be the same repository used by CI/CD for the whole app).
- Configure and control OPAL clients and their associated policy-agents from a unified control plane.
- change the applications data and easily sync authorization to match it.

### 9 - The end users
The users of the application that enjoy a seamless experience.
Through OPAL, the application's authorization layer adjusts to their needs in realtime: a new user can access instantly, new permissions assigned take affect at once, etc.

## OPAL's Pub/Sub channels
OPAL's architecture potentially uses two Pub/Sub channels-
1. Client - Server - lightweight websocket Pub/Sub
2. Server - Server - backbone Pub/Sub

While the lightweight channel requires no additional infrastructure, and can suffice for the can we are running only a single OPAL-server. If we wish to scale-out OPAL-servers, we achieve this using a backbone Pub/Sub (such as Redis, Kafka, or Postgres Listen/Notify) to sync all the servers (So a client connecting to one server, receive notifications of updates that are triggered by another server)
The backbone Pub/Sub is connected to the lightweight Pub/SUb through the [Broadcaster](https://pypi.org/project/broadcaster/) module.

## Communication flows
The following text describes common data/policy events/scenarios in an OPAL system.

### User flows

#### Triggered by authorization queries:
- Users -> App -> PolicyAgent
- Users interact with the application triggering authorization queries that the application resolves with the policy agent (directly). The policy agent is constantly kept up-to date by OPAL so it can answer all the queries correctly.

#### Triggered by authorization data changes:
- Users -> App data service -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Policy Agents
- Users (e.g. customers, operators, partners, developers) affect the applications authorization layer (e.g. create new users, assign new roles). Application service triggers an event to OPAL-server, which notifies the clients, which collect the needed data from the affected sources.

- Policy flows
#### Triggered by admin updates policy:
- Admin -> Git -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients-> Policy Agents
- The application admin commits a new version of the application policy (or subset thereof), triggering a webhook to the OPAL-server,which analyzes the new version, creates a differential update and notifies the OPAL-clients of it via Pub/Sub. The OPAL-clients connect back to the OPAL server (via REST) to retrieve the update itself.

#### Triggered by OPAL-server starts:
- Git -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Policy Agents
- A new OPAL-server node starts, spinning out workers - one worker will be elected as the GitPolicySource. The GitPolicySource worker will retrieve the policy from the repository and share it with the other workers (via the FastAPI Pub/Sub channel) and with other server instances (via the backbone pub/sub [e.g. Kafka, Redis, ...]), and through those to all the currently connected clients (via FastAPI Pub/Sub)

#### Triggered by OPAL-clients starts:
- OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Policy Agents
- The OPAL-client starts and connects to the OPAL-server (via REST) to retrieve it's full policy configuration, caching it directly into the policy-agent.
- OPAL-clients keep the policy up to date, by subscribing to policy updates (via FastAPI Pub/Sub)

### Data flows

#### Application updates authorization data:
- App Service -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Data-Sources -> OPAL-clients -> Policy-Agents
- Following an a state changing event (e.g. user interaction, API call) The application changes authorization data, and triggers an update event to the OPAL-server (via REST), including a configured data-topic. The OPAL-server will then propagate (via FastAPI Pub/Sub) the event to all OPAL-clients which subscribed to the data-topic.
Each client (using it's configured Data [FetchProviders](https://github.com/authorizon/opal/blob/master/docs/howto/write_your_own_fetch_provider.md)) will then approach each relevant data-source directly, aggregate the data, and store it in the policy agent.

#### A third-party updates authorization data:
- Third-party -> App Data Monitoring Service -> OPAL-server -> OPAL-clients -> Data-Sources -> OPAL-clients -> Policy-Agents
- A third-party such as a SaaS service updates data relevant for authorization. The Application monitors such changes, and triggers an update event to the OPAL-server (via REST), including a configured data-topic. The OPAL-server will then propagate (via FastAPI Pub/Sub) the event to all OPAL-clients which subscribed to the data-topic.
Each client (using it's configured Data [FetchProviders](https://github.com/authorizon/opal/blob/master/docs/howto/write_your_own_fetch_provider.md)) will then approach each relevant data-source directly, aggregate the data, and store it in the policy agent.

#### OPAL-client starts:
Once a client start, the following process occures:
OPAL-server - OPAL-clients -> Data-Sources -> OPAL-clients -> Policy-Agents

- OPAL-client connects to OPAL-server (via REST) to download base data-source configuration (for its configured topics); and then using it's configured Data [FetchProviders](https://github.com/authorizon/opal/blob/master/docs/howto/write_your_own_fetch_provider.md)) will approach each relevant data-source directly, aggregate the data, and store it in the policy agent.
