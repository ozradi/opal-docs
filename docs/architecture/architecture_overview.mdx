## Simplified (TL;DR)
OPAL consists of two key components that work together:

### OPAL Server
The OPAL server:
- Creates a Pub/Sub channel clients subscribe to
- Tracks a git repository (via webhook / polling) for updates to policy (or static data)
    - Additional versioned repositories can be supported (e.g. S3, SVN)
- Accepts data update notifications via Rest API
- pushes updates to clients (as diffs)
- scales with other server instances via a configurable backbone pub/sub (Currently supported: Postgres, Redis, Kafka; more options will be added in the future)

### OPAL Client
The OPAL client 
- Deployed alongside a policy-agent, and keeping it up to date.
- Subscribes to Pub/Sub updates, based on topics for data and policy 
- Downloads data-source configurations from server
    - Fetches data from multiple sources (e.g. DBs, APIs, 3rd party services) 
- Downloads policy from server
- Keeps policy agents up to date
