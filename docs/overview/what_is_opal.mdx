## ðŸ’¡ OPAL - data and policy real-time delivery

Modern applications are complex, distributed, multi-tenant, and run at scale - often creating overwhelming authorization challenges.

OPA (Open-Policy-Agent) brings the power of decoupled policy to the infrastructure layer (especially K8s) and light applications.

OPAL supercharges OPA to meet the pace of live applications, where the state relevant to authorization decisions may change with every user click and API call.

OPAL builds on top of OPA, adding real-time updates (via Websocket Pub/Sub) for policy and data.

OPAL embraces decoupling of policy and code and doubles down on decoupling policy (git driven) and data (distributed data-source fetching engines).

## Why OPA + OPAL == ðŸ’ª ðŸ’œ
OPA (Open Policy Agent) is great! 

It decouples policy from code in a highly-performant and elegant way. 

But the challenge of keeping policy agents up-to-date is hard - especially in applications - where each user interaction or API call may affect access-control decisions. 

OPAL runs in the background, supercharging policy agents, keeping them in sync with events in real-time.

## What OPAL _is not_

### A Policy Engine

OPAL uses a policy engine but isn't one itself.
Check out [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org), and [OSO](https://www.osohq.com)

### Large scale Global FGA

Currently, OPAL is not meant for managing ridiculous (>100GB) amounts of data within one layer. 
Though it can complement a CDN to achieve a similar result - see [key concepts and design](../architecture/design.mdx).

### Fullstack authorization

OPAL and OPA essentially provide microservices for authorization.
Developers still need to add control interfaces on top (e.g., user-management, API-key-management, audit, impersonation, invites) both as APIs and UIs
