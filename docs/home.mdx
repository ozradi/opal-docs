OPAL is an open-source project for administrating authorization and access control.

OPAL responds to policy and data changes and pushes live updates to your agents, bringing open policy to the speed needed by live applications.

As you push updates to your application's stores (e.g., Git, DBs, S3, SaaS services), OPAL will make sure your services are always in sync with the authorization data and policy they need (and only those they need.)

## Why use OPAL?
OPAL is the easiest way to keep your solution's authorization layer up-to-date in real-time. It aggregates policy and data from across the field, integrates them seamlessly into the authorization layer, and is microservices and cloud-native.

## OPA + OPAL = üíú
While OPA (Open Policy Agent) decouples policy from code in a highly-performant and elegant way, the challenge of keeping policy agents up-to-date remains. 
This is especially true in applications, where each user interaction or API call may affect access control decisions. 
OPAL runs in the background, supercharging policy agents, keeping them in sync with events in real-time.
