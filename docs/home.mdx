## Background

We are bunch of developers that have been building software for decades, working in dozens of companies of all sizes.  
And we witnessed one thing over and over: we wrote, refactored and patched the same access-control code.

And don't get us wrong - we planned the architecture beforehand, and asked all stakeholders before building.

Unfortunately, there is always a stage that the requirements changes and we are left with refactoring.
Some requirements caused us to regfactor from RBAC to ABAC, others requirements were so stressed we had to patch stuff, and some changes just complicated the code enough to be unreadable. 

Fortunately, there is a movement in the access control world to make it a standalone microservice that all microservices, users, DBs has to go through to get access to a specific resource.

This movement created great open-source projects that solve this specific problem.

## OPA - Open Policy agent 

OPA which stands for Open Policy Agent, is a standalone microservice that decouples code from policy. 
It is an open source project with strong communty always keeping it up to date.

OPA policy is written in Rego code (pronounced rey-go) and is very robust - it supports high-performance queries returning in 1 millisec from the one hand, and very complex policies from the other hand.

OPA is a step function when implementing access-control and already simpllifies our life.

## When OPA isn't enough?

OPA was built for a specific case and to be deployed as part of your CI/CD.
This means, that your policy changes are not reflected in real-time, and once your policy changes, you need to deploy.

Moreover, if part of your policy relies on data coming from 3rd party vendors and can update in real-time, OPA can't support that.
In example, let's say your policy limits the access to the staging environment to the office IP.
Every time the user's IP changes, you need to update the user's permissions to update access to staging environment.

## OPAL.ac - Making OPA updated in real-time

OPAL was built to add a real-time layer to your agent.

It is an administration layer for Open Policy Agent (OPA), detecting changes in realtime to both policy and policy data and pushing live updates to your agents. 

OPAL is built to be fast, scalable, and extendable so it will be the last access control you will have to implement.

## Get Started

- Integrate permissions into your app
- Edit the policy in the policy editor
